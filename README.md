# business-analytic-project
A Rep of my Business Analytic Project in NYP Y2S1

So Far, Only 2 materials could be recovered (Pc PSU went into flames and electric shock the HDD)
1. BAP Poster - My Team's Poster of all of final dashboards along with the use cases
2. Linear Reg - A Model that i used to predict the average expectancy of Singapore Birthrate

*Minor Side Note: I realise now (2022) that i should have used a forecasting model instead of a regression model*
*Will Update files into project when found*
